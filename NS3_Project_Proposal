Dear Students,

Next week in your respective lab times, you will present your NS3 project proposal. Each student must prepare a slide/pdf addressing the following points:

Modified Algorithm (as directed in the guideline)
Expected output after the modification (benefits/intuition behind the idea)
Reference (if the idea is based on an existing source e.g. paper/journal/blog)
Please note that
You will get a maximum of 2 minutes to present your proposal. So, try to keep it succinct.
You will also have to submit the slide/pdf by 8.00AM on 16 January 2021.
Your project proposal will be graded.
